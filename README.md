# TextReplacerExtension
Chrome extension that replaces defined a "/&lt;keyword>" combo with desired text. 

For example, if a keyword of "test" is defined, with a text of "This is a test", when inside a text box in Chrome, if you type "/test", it will be replaced with "This is a test". 

Multiple token/text sets may be created. This only works within most standard text boxes.
